### SIR-based-disease-spreading-model

**Time:** December 2021 - March 2022

**Coursework:** STAT 378 Scientific Computing with Python

**Programming Language:** Python (ipynb)

**Keywords:** Implementing mathematical models with Python, 2D model visualization with Matplotlib, selecting and evaluating model parameters. 


In this project, I worked with three teammates to model how a new disease spreads throughout a population with the implementation of 
1. A discrete agent-based simulation
2. A continuous / ODE simulation
3. A 2-dimensional spatial component to both the agent-based and continuous models. 
 
Some ideas of the examples of the parameters we took into considerations were:
1. Modeling the use of masks to slow disease spread
2. Modeling the use of quarantine, social distancing, etc.
3. Modeling contagion on a social network (e.g. conspiracy theory)
4. Fitting the SIR model to COVID-19 data
5. Implementing a large-scale/high-performance version of the continuous model
6. Modeling the appearance of a new strain which might re-infect recovered individuals
7. A nice visualization relating to the project
